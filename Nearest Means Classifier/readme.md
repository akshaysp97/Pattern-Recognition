# Nearest Means Classifier
In this project I have developed a nearest-means classifier, using Euclidean distance (L2 norm) and the error-rate computation function.
The classifier is trained on 3 datatsets namely Synthetic1, Synthetic2 and Wine datasets. The classification error rate on the training set the the test set is calculated for each.
