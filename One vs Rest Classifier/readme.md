# One vs Rest Classifier
In this project, a nearest-means classifier with the multiclass approach: one vs. rest was developed for the wine dataset.
The following metrics are calculated:
(a) Classification accuracy on training set and on testing set.
(b) Plots showing each resulting 2-class decision boundary and regions.
(c) A plot showing the final decision boundaries and regions.
